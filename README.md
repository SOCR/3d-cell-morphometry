# [SOCR](http://socr.umich.edu/) 3D Cell Morphometry Project

This is the repository for workflows, source code, and documentation associated with the [3D Cell Morphometry Project](http://www.socr.umich.edu/projects/3d-cell-morphometry).

3D microscopic imaging data and derived binary masks are available for downloading from the [project data webpage](http://www.socr.umich.edu/projects/3d-cell-morphometry/data.html).

## Structure of the repository:

Materials are provided in 2 parts corresponding to [publications](#Publications):

1. [3D cell nuclear morphology: microscopy imaging dataset](./1_3D_cell_nuclear_morphology:_microscopy_imaging_dataset)
2. [3D cell nuclear shape modeling, morphometry, and classification](./2_3D_cell_nuclear_shape_modeling_morphometry)
 
We also provide an example of how to use these materials in the pipeline workflow:

[Nuclear morphometric classification demo workflow](./demo)
